         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:614:3"/> and Religion. But if they imagined any ſuch thing ſurely they were mighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceaued: and ſome of the learned amongſt them (I meane the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall) might haue informed them, that this conceit or opinion inclined to the practiſe of the old <hi>Heretikes</hi> the <hi>Donatists,</hi> againſt whom <hi>S. Augustine</hi> writte many bookes aboue a thouſand yeares agoe,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>1.</hi> con.

<pb facs="tcp:614:3"/> abſolutly <hi>Rebaptiſe,</hi> but with Condition: <hi>If thou arte not Baptiſed, I Baptiſe thee.</hi> But this will not ſerue their turne, but rather betrayeth their ignorance? For they ought not to <hi>Rebaptiſe,</hi> vpon Condition, but when there is probable doubt, that the partie preſented vnto them is not <hi>Baptiſed.</hi> Here is no ſuch matter, but proteſtation made by the parents or others that the Child is allready <hi>Baptiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For a ſecond reaſon<note place="margin">The Second reaſon.</note> I imagine they could not ſo much as thinke that the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> practiſed in the <hi>Roman Catholike Church</hi> or by a <hi>Roman Catholike Prieſt</hi> was no <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> was not auaylable, and therfore they made this ſtatute and law. For if this doctrine were true, woe then to their <hi>Protestanticall</hi> congregation. For firſt, then many of them were not <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they neuer had any head of their <hi>Church a Chriſtian.</hi> They haue had but fower heads of their <hi>Church,</hi> and they of diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſorts: An old man, a man of middle age, a woman, and a child; and theſe fower all different in age, or ſexe, and all fower baptiſed <hi>Catholiklie</hi> by a <hi>Catholike Bishop</hi> or <hi>Priest</hi> according to the <hi>Roman</hi> vſe. But if <hi>Baptiſme</hi> acted and done by a
<pb facs="tcp:614:4"/> 
               <hi>Catholike Bishop</hi> or <hi>Prieſt</hi> according to the <hi>Roman</hi> vſe were not auaylable, why then no <hi>Baptiſme</hi> no <hi>Chriſtianitie,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie the head of their <hi>Church</hi> no <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi> For K. <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight the firſt head of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> was <hi>Catholikly Baptiſed</hi> before <hi>Protestancie</hi> was preached. King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth a Chid a boy, he alſo was <hi>Baptiſed</hi> according to the <hi>Roman</hi> vſe by <hi>Henry</hi> his Father. And for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> she was baptiſed <hi>Catholiklie,</hi> &amp; God ſaue all good toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) as the report goeth, she berayed the font. And for our King Iames,<note place="margin">Premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</note> who now rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth, he reporteth him ſelf that he was <hi>Baptiſed</hi> by a <hi>Catholike Bishop.</hi> And for the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> I had rather an other should examine then my ſelf. But what milke he ſucked from his nurces breaſt I know not, but ſure I am his mother, from whom he had his being and firſt entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce into this world, was a Conſtant <hi>Roman Catholike</hi> and a worthie Queene and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</hi> But to conclud the ſtatute ſure was not acted vpon conceat that <hi>Catholikes</hi> did not trulie <hi>Baptiſe,</hi> and that by <hi>Catholike Baptiſme</hi> they were not true <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Some other reaſon they had, and
<pb facs="tcp:614:4"/> what may that be?</p>
            <p>Thirdly their motiue ſurely might be to gette monie,<note place="margin">The third reaſon.</note> and begger and impouerish <hi>Catholikes.</hi> This in deed hath wrought ſome effect.

                  <hi>Tobi.</hi> 2.</note> We read that old <hi>Tobie</hi> by reaſon he did obſerue his <hi>Religion,</hi> burie the dead, releeue and comfort the afflicted, who were perſecuted for their Conſciences (and this he did contrarie to
<pb facs="tcp:614:5"/> the lawes and commaundement of the <hi>King Sennacherib</hi>) he grewe into miſeries, was ſtroken blind by miſchaunce, had wants, became verie poore: yet afterward the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſayeth: God ſent his <hi>Angell</hi> reſtored him to his ſight, and he became againe verie rich. In like manner God ſuffered Iob to be tryed in the loſſe of his wealth and goods,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.</note> in the death of his Children and ſore punishment of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: yet afterward his welth was reſtored, his Children multiplied, and he recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his former health.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The motiues to write this treatiſe.</note>And firſt (Good <hi>Reader</hi>) I tooke this matter in hand to let thee vnderſtand what <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is, and the neceſſitie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to ſaluation. It is here on earth the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt begining of <hi>Chriſtianitie:</hi> the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> the houſe of God:<note place="margin">The reaſon of the title of the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.</note> the high-way to all other <hi>Sacraments,</hi> in ſo much that without this no other <hi>Sacrament</hi> is auaylable: a washing
<pb facs="tcp:614:8"/> and cleanſing our ſoules from all ſinne <hi>Originall</hi> and others: a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for all paines due for ſinne eternall or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: a deliuerie from the bondage and power of the <hi>Diuell:</hi> a reſtorer of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie: an incorporation to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as members of his bodie myſticall: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a reconciliation vnto the grace &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God Almightie, wherby we are made the adopted Sonnes of God, Coheyres and inheritors with <hi>Chriſt</hi> of the kingdome of heauen. Hath it all theſe effects? Take heed then that thou lay the foundation ſure of thy <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> that is: that thou be truely <hi>Baptiſed</hi> and Chriſtened.</p>
            <p>The ſecond motiue was to lay open <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and make plaine vnto thee by way of queſtions and doubts (which I ſuppoſe to be the eaſieſt and plaineſt Courſe for thy better vnderſtanding) the effects, the matter, the forme, the miniſter as well in neceſſitie as in publike Celebration, with the ſolemnitie and Ceremonies of this <hi>Sacrament;</hi> For that thou being more fullie herein inſtructed, thou mayeſt haue a more eſpeciall care to haue it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie effected and trulie performed in
<pb facs="tcp:614:9"/> theſe daungerous tymes of hereſie. For aſſuredly this is the gate that openeth to heauen: which if it should be shutte and not duely miniſtred, there were no hope of ſaluation, but all open to hell and damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly to giue thee a Caueat and warning of the daungerous opinions and aſſertions,<note place="margin">The daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</note> which are taught and ſpread abroad of this <hi>Sacrament</hi> by the <hi>Sectaries</hi> of this age. The firſt daungerous poynt of doctrine is, that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme</hi> was inſtitued by <hi>S. Iohn Baptist:</hi> and that the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>S. Iohns,</hi> is all one and the ſelfe ſame; which is againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>Scripture</hi> and reaſon. For then we muſt needs ſay, that the firſt and chiefe <hi>Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> of the new <hi>Testament</hi> and <hi>Ghospell</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> should be inſtituted by a precedent <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> and not by <hi>Chriſt</hi> him ſelf, which were abſurde, ſeing all <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> haue their inſtitution by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and their force and vertue from his death and <hi>Paſsion.</hi> Secondly that this <hi>Sacrament</hi> doth not conferre grace, cleanſe the ſoule from ſinne as an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient inſtrumentall cauſe by <hi>Chriſt</hi> inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and endued with that vertu; which
<pb facs="tcp:614:9"/> were to deſtroy <hi>Baptiſme.</hi> Thirdlie that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> doth not impreſſe in the ſoule a ſeale, ſigne, and Character of <hi>Chriſtianitie</hi> inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible for euer; which is to make no diſtinction betweene Iewe, Gentill, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Fourthly that he, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is once <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> can not be damned; which were to ſet all at libertie; and make men careleſſe of all other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> life. Fifthly that the only memorie of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
               <hi>Baptiſme</hi> doth iuſtifie from our ſinnes, which we shall commit after <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> which were to take away all ſatisfaction, repentance and penance; and other ſuch like abſurdities, and daungerous poynts of <hi>Doctrine</hi> againſt <hi>Scripture, Councells, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and all antiquitie.</p>
            <p>Finallie I would haue thee to conſider with what ſubtiltie the <hi>Deuill</hi> hath endeauoured in theſe latter tymes by his inſtruments the <hi>Heretikes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The fourth motiue.</note> to diſgrace the beautie of <hi>Chriſts Spouſe</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> to depopulate roote vp, and deſtroy like wild boares the vineyard of our Lord. And I compare the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> to the tree of life placed in the middeſt of <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> which the <hi>Heretikes</hi> of this age, ſome of them haue hacked and hewed at

               <note place="margin">Luther in Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis collo. ca. <hi>17.</hi>

This externall action is this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which God doth vſe as his inſtrument for the iuſtification, washing and cleanſing of the ſoule of man: Then is the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ordained the ordinarie miniſter of God to execute this ſacrament or externall action in whome there is required that he haue power, authoritie and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion to doe it and intention to effect it.

               <p>IT is an abſurd and vnconſcionable dealing, yea a great ſlaunder and calumnie of <hi>Caluin</hi> and his complices to ſay that <hi>Catholikes in their Doctrine,</hi> doe reſigne and tye the vertue and power of God to externall ſimboles and <hi>ſignes.</hi> As though they taught that in <hi>Baptiſme</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; the word without God did remitte ſinne. It were a vaine thinge to thinke that when the carpenter doeth vſe his ſawe as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſe to breake, cut or deuide timber, to ſay that the ſawe doth cut, worke, or breake timber of it ſelf without the carpenter. So Almightie God, although he vſe the externall ſignes, that is the word and water in <hi>Baptiſme</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:614:18"/> to cleanſe the ſoule and remit ſinne as ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and inſtrumentall cauſes: yet not ſo that they should worke of themſelues without God, but God by them doth effect iuſtification and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinne. Neither doth he reſigne his power ſo to theſe externall ſignes, that they worke theſe effects in them ſelues, and not he in them and with them: but as in the precedent chapter I ſayed, God doth vſe in <hi>Baptiſme</hi> water and the word as his inſtrument, and by force of the word and worke done grace is giuen, and ſinne remitted. Therfore they are not vſed (as ſome heretikes of this tyme auerre) as bare ſignes and ſimboles, or onlie meanes to excite, ſtirre vp, or moue to faith; and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterward by faith onelie to be iuſtified.

It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that the Ghoſpell, the word of God preached is a greate motiue, and forceable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to moue vs to beleeue and to ſtrengthen our faith: and <hi>S.

For that the immediate effecte of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> by applying the merits of <hi>Chriſt Paſſion,</hi> is remiſſion of ſinnes to ſaluation, is a newe regeneration and opening the gate to heauen. And this plainlie <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake to <hi>Nicodemus:</hi>

               <p>That the effect of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is the remiſſion of ſinne the <hi>Scripture</hi> is plaine. The people of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Iurie</hi> at the firſt ſermon <hi>S. Peter</hi> made,<note place="margin">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:614:22"/> all manner of ſinnes, either contracted in our firſt parents, or committed in acte by our ſelues, that is either originall or actuall, be they mortall, or veniall. The difficultie nowe is, in that there are ſinnes beſides Originall prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that is: ſinnes paſt and going before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in thoſe of perfect age: and there are ſinnes ſubſequent; that is committed after Baptiſme. Nowe the queſtion is, whether Baptiſme extend it ſelf to ſinnes committed after, or onlie contained it ſelf within the bounde of thoſe committed before. Ins the generall doctrine of the Catholike Church, that if we committe any ſinne after Baptiſme, we muſt ſeeke to releeue our ſelues not by Baptiſme, but by other meanes; that is: by the ſacrament of Penance.<note place="margin">Aug. ep. <hi>23.</hi> ad Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nif.</note> And S.

Wherefore Baptiſme is not the remedie for ſinnes committed after that Sacrament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, but we muſt recurre to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Confeſſion by Chriſts owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>Let therefore no Heretike lull you a ſleepe in this plauſible doctrine and Epicurian practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe: that if you fall out of the shippe you entred into by Baptiſme, and make shipwracke, and looſe by ſinne your firſt grace receaued in Baptiſme, that you shall not need to take hold and handfaſt of the ſecond table, that is the Sacrament of Penance: but that the memorie onlie of Baptiſme, shall be ſufficient to recouer you without contrition, confeſſion, or ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction either to God or man, or anie other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishement due for ſinne.

               <p>I moue this queſtion in reſpect of Caluin, becauſe he willing to maintaine Baptiſme not to be neceſſarie as the ordinarie meanes by Chriſt inſtituted to ſaluation, doth abſolutlie denie, That Chriſt here in this Chapter recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Euangeliſt, doth intreate of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſme:<note place="margin">

I call it a fained interpretation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it proceedeth from Caluins owne fancie.

                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Luc.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</note> that Chriſt shall Baptiſe in the Holy Ghoſt and fire: but fire maketh no Sacrament, nor is neceſſarie to ſaluation, but onlie expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the effects of the Holie Ghoſt: ſo why should the word (water) doe anie more. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere:<note place="margin">Sol.</note> theſe words recited: that Chriſt should Baptiſe in the holie Ghoſt and fire, were not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Chriſt himſelf, but by his Prophet S.

But this was but once effected and done and that vpon the Apoſtles onlie, and neuer propoſed by Chriſt as an ordinarie meanes for all

               <p>Secondly <hi>Caluin</hi> might haue marked, if he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> would, and ſo may his Complices: that this word (fire) is put after the word <hi>(Holy Ghost)</hi> as expreſſing the effects, that the Holie Ghoſt may worke: as to illuminate, enflame, and heate the hart and ſoule with faith and Charitie, as fire doeth the bodie externallie. But the word <hi>(water)</hi> is put before the Holie Ghoſt by <hi>Chriſt</hi> as in his proper ſignification, and concurring togeather with the Holie Ghoſt to the ſpirituall generation and new birth of man to life in <hi>Christ:</hi> therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And no doubt he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned water to be the matter of Baptiſme when he would vouchſafe to conſecrate, illuſtrate, and make famous the water by the touch of his moſt holie and pure fleſh.

Concernig ſea water, ſome there are; who moue ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and make ſome difficultie, becauſe it is not ſimple and pure water as the other waters are; but troubled, mixte, muddie and ſalte: yet all Diuines generallie hold, that ſea water is ſufficient, and true water for this Sacrament. Becauſe it is elementall, hath the Species and forme of true water, and all other elementall water doth iſſue, ſpring, and hath his begining from the ſeas, and neuer reſteth, but runneth continually vntill it arriue vnto the ſea againe, from whence it had his begining, becauſe the ſea is the naturall and proper place for the waters. And no doubt Chriſt made choyſe, and inſtituted this naturall, elementall, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water, for the vſe of this Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is vſuall, and ordinarie in all places and countreys, and common to all people, rich and poore.

               <p>I ſay theſe two are eſſentiall partes of Batiſme; for neither the water without the word, nor the word without the water, can worke anie effect; but it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie that the matter &amp; the forme goe ioyntlie

               <p>THe reaſon of this queſtion is, becauſe the Greeke Church doeth differ ſomewhat from the forme of the Latine Church. Their forme is: <hi>Baptizetur ſeruus Chriſti. N. talis. In In nomine Patris, &amp; Filij, &amp; Spiritus Sancti. Amen. The ſeruant of Chriſt Iohn or Thomas, be he, or let him be Baptiſed: In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt. Amen.</hi> The Latine Church, that is, the Roman hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes vſed this forme. <hi>Iohn or Thomas, I Baptiſe thee: In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> The difference of and in theſe two formes of Baptiſme is, that the Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes in their Baptiſme doe not attribute the acte of Baptiſme vnto the Prieſt, or Miniſter,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:614:43"/> who Baptizeth, as the Roman Church doth. For they ſay co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding, or in the Imperatiue Moode: Be he, or let him be Baptiſed: but the Prieſt in the Roman inſtitution doeth abſoutlie ſaye in the preſent Tenſe: I Baptiſe thee. The reaſon of this difference and alteration in the Greeke Church, and amongſt the Grecians was, becauſe at the firſt in the verie begining of Chriſtianitie amongſt them, there grewe a Schiſme and errour in that they did attribute too much vnto the partie, who Baptiſed them; As appeareth by S. Paule, who dehorteth the Corinthians from their Schifmaticall boaſting againſt one an other in their Baptiſers,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor. cap.</hi> 1.</note> telling them that they muſt boaſt only in Chriſt for their Baptiſme. Some contentiouſly ſay: <hi>I certes am Paules; and I Apolloes. But I take Baptiſme of Cephas, I of Apollo; I of Paule.</hi> So that to auoyd this errour and Schiſme, this alteration of the forme of Baptiſme grewe: Yet not with ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there is no doubt but this their forme is ſufficient and auailable: For although the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Baptiſing, or the Baptizer, be not particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie declared: Yet the acte, which is performed by the Sacrament is expreſſed, which is ſufficient. And the forme in ſubſtance really doth not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Latine Church: neither is there anie eſſentiall parte left out, nor reall alteration in the forme. And this was defined and decreed in the Councell of Florence.<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſeſſ. vlt. de Bap.</note> Wherby it may be gathered, that by the generall conſent of the Church, for the auoyding of Contention Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me or Hereſie, there may be alteration, in the verie forme of Sacraments, ſo that they doe not take away or touch anie eſſentiall part thereof.

               <p>THe Church of God alwayes acknowledged the Baptiſme of Heretikes to be ſufficient, when they haue not altered anie eſſentiall parte of the forme.

Out of which two places ſome haue gathered, that Baptiſme onely mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the name of Ieſus without the inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bleſſed Trinitie, the Father, the Sonne, the holy Ghoſte, was ſufficient and auaylable; alſo ſo commaunded and permitted by the two Chiefe Apoſtles S. Peter &amp; S. Paule.</p>
               <p>Not withſtanding theſe two places of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, in myne opinion there ought to be no doubt (as hath bene proued before) but that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Baptiſme was inſtituted, determined and commaunded by Chriſt himſelf to be: In the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:614:44"/> name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt. And therfore no way to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe it was Chriſts Inſtitution; nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or auaylable without the Inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the whole Trinitie, the Father, the Sonne, &amp; the Holy Ghoſt. Wherfore as I ſayed, theſe two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture are hard &amp; difficul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall doctrine of the aunce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers, &amp; the practiſe of the Church hath euer beene to Baptiſe: In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne &amp; of the Holy Ghoſt: and neuer to awarrant or approue Baptiſme miniſtred onely in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, or onely in the name of the Father, or onely in the name of the Holy Ghoſt. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to thinke that S. Peter, nor S. Paule commaunded or permitted Baptiſme to be onely in the name of Chriſt or Ieſus. As concerning S. Paule it is plaine he asked the twelue he found at Epheſus, whether they had receyued the Holie Ghoſt? They anſuered:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 19.</note> Nay neither haue we heard whether there be a holy Ghoſt. But he ſayed: In whom then were yee Baptiſed? As if he should haue ſayd: why then no Baptiſme without the Father, the Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and the Holy Ghoſt. They anſwered: In Iohns Baptiſme. But that not being ſufficient, he farther inſtructed them in Chriſt, and the Holy Ghoſt. So that there is no doubt but Chriſts Baptiſme according to S. Paule was: In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holie Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Werefore we muſt vnderſtand S. Luke who writeth the two Apoſtles to haue commaunded Baptiſme in the name of our Lord Ieſus, not ſo, that it was onlie in the name of Ieſus, but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:614:45"/> with all in the name of the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, Or we may ſuppoſe that S. Luke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Chriſt Ieſus onlie for the greater honour of his name: altough the Baptiſme was in the name of the whole Trinitie. Or we may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete S. Luke that he would ſay the Apoſtles to haue Baptized in the name of Chriſt Ieſus that is: In the fayth of our Lord Ieſus, or by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Chriſt, or with the Baptiſme, vhich Chriſt had inſtituted; and ſo for breuities ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke to haue named onlie Chriſt, not deni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing the Trinitie. And Iuſtinus Martyr thinketh that the Apoſtles might adde the name of Ieſus to the forme which Chriſt had inſtituted ſaying: <hi>Ego Baptizo te, In nomine Patris, &amp; Filij eius Ieſu Christi, &amp; Spiritus Sancti: I Baptiſe thee, In the name of the Father, and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Wherfore I conclude, if any ſhould vpon mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking or errour of theſe places Baptiſe onlie in the name Chriſt, or onlie in the name of Ieſus, not inuocating the Bleſſed Trinitie, it were no Baptiſe.</p>

For as we haue ſayed, the firſt Sacrament, which is Baptiſme, Chriſt in proper perſon with his owne hands did Baptiſe the Apoſtles.

Or, my will is no further but to wash your feete only. When. S. Peter vpon humilitie thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vnworthie that Chriſt should wash his feete.

Chriſt did Baptize at the firſt inſtitution and begining of his Baptiſme: and then afterwarde Chriſt did not Baptiſe himſelf, but committed this office and function to his Diſciples as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto them; and he himſelf tooke a higher charge and care vpon him, which was: to preach, and teach and confirme by miracles. So did alſo the Apoſtles after Chriſts aſcenſion in the begining Baptize them ſelues: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that their preaching might not be hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they committed this office and function as proper to the Prieſt, and betooke them ſelues, To Euangelize,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> and not Baptiſe, as S. Paule ſayeth. So that we may vnderſtand S. Iohn, when he ſayeth: That Chriſt did not Baptize, but his Diſciples: that is, he did not ordinarilie by himſelf with his owne hands Baptize all ſorts of people, but only ſome of his Apoſtles and Diſciples. And when he had done thus, he gaue commiſſion to them as his Miniſters to Baptize all others. Wherfore when Chriſt ſayed vpon the day of his aſcenſion, that his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:614:47"/> Apoſtles should be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt vpon the day of Pentecoſte, we muſt not ſo vnderſtand, as though they had not bene Baptized before with water: but that they should be cleanſed, Baptized, and inflamed with a ſpeciall internall infuſion of the grace of the holy Ghoſt, vnder the viſible forme of fierie tongues, as hauing therby no ordinarie baptiſme, but an extraordinarie gift of the Holy Ghoſt to ſpeake with tongues, and by an eſpeciall grace of his heauenly ſpirit, that they might Euangelize with courage Chriſt crucified, which was then: <hi>Scandalum Iudaeis, &amp; ſtultitia Gentibus.

               <p>IT is the generall opinion of Catholike Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that ordinarilie by office and function it appertaineth onlie to Prieſts to Baptize. This word (only) muſt not exclude Bishops, for that they are alſo Prieſts, and doe Baptize as Prieſts. Yea in the opinion of ſome, although the Prieſt by office and function in his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that he is made Prieſte, hath this power to Baptize: yet becauſe it is a matter of Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, he doeth exerciſe it with a ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and dependencie of the Bishoppe. As alſo the Prieſt hath by ordination, in that he is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:614:48"/> Prieſt, power to abſolue from ſinne: Yet becauſe the acte of Abſolution is an acte of Iuriſdiction, and Iuriſdiction is proper to a Bishoppe, he can not vſe and exerciſe this power except in caſe of neceſſitie, but within ſuch limites as the Bishops shall appoynt. So then ordinarilie by office and function it, appertayneth to the Prieſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Baptize, and not to the Biſhop as Biſhop. Werfore altough the Biſhop may doe it: yet we can not ſay he doth it: <hi>Ex officio,</hi> as Biſhop, but as Prieſt. And this appeareth and may be proued out of S. Paule, of whom there is no doubt but he was a Biſhop: yet he ſayeth that Chriſt ſent him:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>To Euangelize, not to Baptize:</hi> for that it is not by Chriſts Commiſſion and inſtitution the office of a Biſhop to Baptize by himſelf as in his owne perſon, but ordinarilie it is committed by office and function as belonging to the Prieſt. Yet in the ſame place S.

The reaſons for proofe of this Concluſion are pregnant and many. Firſt it is not of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Baptiſme that the Miniſter, that is, he that Baptizeth, be in holy Orders: therfore in neceſſitie it may be lawfull for a meere Lay-man to miniſter this Sacrament.

Idle then and erroneous muſt needs be the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Caluin, And not onlie are the Sectaries of this age content to approue &amp; allow with Caluin, that parents rather should permitte their Children to dye without Baptiſme, then in any caſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer to ſeeke or ſuffer ther Sacrament to be giuen or miniſtred by any Lay perſon, Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie (I ſay) doe they mayntaine this wicked po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and dangerous doctrine concerning chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Infants: but alſo would counſell and aduiſe men of age and vnderſtanding newlie conuerted, if they should be in danger of death, not hauing any Prieſt or miniſter readie, rather to relie vpon their faith, then to demaund Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme at a Lay-mans hand.

               <p>IT is manifeſt and doubted of few or none that in the Primitiue Church in the begining of Chriſtianitie this Sacrament was miniſtred in priuate houſes &amp; not in publike places, by reaſon at that tyme there were no publike Churches or Chappells builded, neither were the Chriſtians ſuffered anie publike vſe or exerciſe of their Religion; but continually pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by Purſeuants, and other ſuch like officers, &amp; extreamly perſecuted by the Pagan Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours. I may well compare this tyme and ſtate now of England with that of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church. For it is euident to the whole world, that Chriſtian Catholike people of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, are forced to Baptize priuatlie in their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:614:52"/> houſes, and that with hazarde of great penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they are allowed no publike Church, nor Chappell, no publike vſe or exerciſe of their Religion, but their Prieſts, the true Miniſters of this Sacrament, are continuallie purſued by Purſeuants and other Officers, and extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perſecuted by Proteſtans euen to death. But after the Church began to be ſetled, perſecution to ceaſe, Chriſtianitie to floriſh, the vſe and exerciſe of Religion permitted, then were Churches builded, fonts and Baptiſteries publiklie erected, as is euident and at this day extant in the Mother-Church of the world in the Cittie of Rome; There is now ſtanding: Baptiſterium Conſtantin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And in proceſſe of tyme becauſe, ſome began rather to Baptize in their priuate houſes, then publiklie at the fonts and Baptiſteries of the Church, in the Councell of Vienna priuate Baptiſme was forbidden in houſes, and publike commun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as may appeare by the Conſtitution of Clement the Fifth;<note place="margin">Clem. tit. de Baptiſ.</note> except alwayes in caſe of neceſſitie, in danger of death, or as a prerogatiue for Princes Children. Wherfore I may conclude that in England, notwithſtanding this. Conſtitution, we may lawfullie Baptize in priuate houſes, becauſe we are in caſe of neceſſitie as in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:614:52"/> the Primitiue Church: no Churches, fonts, nor Baptiſteries allowed, no publike exerciſe of Religion, our Prieſts purſued, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to death.

And priuate Baptiſme, we call that, which is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in caſe of neceſſitie by a Lay-man or woman priuatlie without ſolemnitie or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, not in Church, nor Cappell, but in priuate houſes. I ſuppoſe in the precedent chapter I haue ſufficientlie proued, that it may lawfullie be done, and being ſo done, to be ſufficient and auaylable, This controuerſie was particularlie handled betweene the Proetſtant Bishops, and the Puritans, in the preſence of Kinh Iames at the Conference at Hampton Court, 1603.</p>

For nothing is perfect that wanteth his eſſentiall parte.</hi> Why then doe they admitte for baptized thoſe who haue had Lay-men for their Baptizers, and not Rebaptize them againe? For either they muſt needes ſay, that Baptiſme is not abſolutlie neceſſarie to ſaluation, and therfore not neceſſarie to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſe

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:614:54"/> diſagree and depart from their firſt Euangeliſt martin Luther, and the Proteſtants in thus yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, from them ſelues.

               <p>Let vs but conſider that the principall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in Baptiſme is Chriſt, and that he onlie as the principall cauſe, doeth worke the effect therof; and that man is but the Inſtrumentall cauſe, and miniſter onlie of Chriſts. If then in the abſence of the Prieſt, who was by Chriſt appoynted as the ordinarie miniſter of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the Lay man in caſe of neceſſitie may lawfullie ſupplie his roome and Baptize, (as I haue proued before) why may not alſo in the like caſe of neceſſitie the woman ſupplie the place of the man in his abſence?<note place="margin">

And for that it is not conuenient nor decent that men should be preſent at the birth of Children, the Church hath commaunded that the midwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe vpon payne of ſinne, learne diſtinctlie the forme of Baptiſme: becauſe she hath ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:614:54"/> licence and commiſſion in danger of death to miniſter this Sacrament. It is true that the fourth councell of Carthage doth forbid women to Baptize, that is:<note place="margin">Concil. Carth. ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>99.</hi> &amp; <hi>200.</hi>

               <p>For Confirmation that women may Baptize, we haue an example in Scripture of Sephora Moyſes wife;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exo.</hi> 4.</note> she circumciſed her ſonne in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of neceſſitie, and although Moyſes was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: yet he was ſore ſicke, vexed with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, threatned death that he could not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it himſelf.

But Circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was a figure of Baptiſme: Therfore as in circumciſion, ſo alſo in Baptiſme in caſe of neceſſitie as Sephora did the one, why may not the midwife doe the other? It is a world and wonder to conſider, that theſe kind of men can approue and allow a woman to be head of the Church, and not permitte in caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a woman to Baptize.

               <p>True it is in deed, and they may wnderſtand if they will,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that S.

And for farther confirmation hereof, you may read a miracle related by Bredenbacius: In the yeare of our Lorde 1579. it happened in Amſterda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me that a Catholike woman being married vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Caluiniſt, and deliuered of a child, she cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Infant priuatlie to be Baptized by a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike woman of her own profeſſion in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, becauſe she would be ſure her child should be trulie Baptized. So it fell out, that

               <p>A Catholike woman being married vnto a Caluiniſt brought forth a child, whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecretlie, his wife being a ſleepe, tooke away and brought him vnto a preaching mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to be Baptized; who being readie to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe in the preſence of the aſſemblie, perceyued the child to be dead. Whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preſentlie he did expoſtulate and reaſon with the Father, what he meant to delude and mocke him, and to bring a dead child to be Baptized? The father being ſtroken in a maze with this vnlooked for miſchance returned home and layd againe the dead Infant by the mothers ſide; And ſo ſecree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie departing from the chamber, a litle after returning, called vpon his wife, and asked how she and the Infant did. She being ignorant what was done, anſwered all was well, and turning her ſelf with pleaſing countenance, offered the child aliue and in good liking to the Father. He being aſtonished with this miracle reiected his Caluinian errours and hereſies, embraced the Catholike faith, became one of his wifes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and cauſed the Infant to be Baptiſed Catholiquelie.</p>
               <p>And for the Miniſter that he be not too haſtie to Rebaptize the Child alreadie Baptized by a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:614:60"/> Catholike midwife, let him read what happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at Amſterdame in the yeare of our Lord 1579. as teſtifieth Bredenbacius.<note place="margin">Brede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. li. <hi>7.</hi> coll. Sacra. c. <hi>51.</hi>

               <p>THe generall opinion is that one can not Baptize himſelf, no not in danger of death, or what other neceſſitie ſoeuer. For better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding I will propoſe the caſe: For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. A Iew or a Pagan hauing heard or read of Baptiſme, or liued ſometyme amongſt the Chriſtians, and being deſirous of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie lying at the poynt of death amongſt his owne, neere no Chriſtian, and ſo conſequentlie haueing no meanes to get any other man to Baptize him: taketh water putting himſelf the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin ſaying: <hi>I Baptize thee in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The queſtion is, whether in this caſe he be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and receaue the Sacrament of Baptiſme. The reſolution is, that he is not Baptiſed, nor can of himſelf receaue the Sacrement of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. The reaſon is, for that Baptiſme is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall birth or regeneration but no man can be generated or borne of himſelf, but neceſſarilie of an other: ſo no man can be Baptized of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but of neceſſitie muſt be Baptized of an other. Alſo it is gathered out of Chriſts owne words; that the Baptizer muſt be a different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the Baptized. For he ſayed to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: <hi>Goe yee and Baptize all nations.</hi> And to ſignifie thus much, we may alſo thinke that Chriſt would not Baptize himſelf, but be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of Iohn. If you doe aske me what I thinke
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:614:62"/> of this Iewe or Pagan, in this caſe, whether he ſhould be ſaued or not? I anſwere with Pope Innocentius the Third: that he could not be ſaued by the Sacrament of Baptiſme, for that he had it not: but no doubt he might be ſaued by the fayth, vowe, and deſire of baptiſme, and the zeale, feruour and loue to Chriſt, and ſo he might haue it ſupplied by Chriſt in will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

               <p>ALL Diuines agree, &amp; it is decreed in two generall Councells of Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and Trent, and deduced expreſslie out of Scripture, that to the ſubſtance of Baptiſme as neceſſarie are three thinges; that is: water as the matter, the words as the forme, and a miniſter to doe it and effect it. For the two firſt I haue ſufficiently proued before in my ſecond booke, that they are the two eſſentiall partes of Baptizme: now that the miniſter muſt of neceſſitie haue intention to doe this acte I will briefly ſhewe. When Chriſt inſtituted this Sacrament, and gaue the forme he ſayed to his Apoſtles: <hi>Goe yee Baptizing:</hi> no man can thinke,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.</note> but that Chriſt meant that they ſhould intend, what he had inſtituted. Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlie, if a man ſhould take water, ſay the words, and caſt it, and powre it vpon an other, and haue no intention to Baptize, it were no Sacrament,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:614:62"/> no Baptiſme, becauſe there was no intention to doe the acte of Baptiſme. As alſo if a player vpon a ſtage ſhould but ſhew the acte of Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, no man would ſay he Baptized: And why? There was water, the word, the miniſter, and all other things. Becauſe there wanted in the player intention to doe the acte of Baptiſme. In like manner if a drunken man, who had loſt the vſe of reaſon, or if a madde man, or if a Prieſt ſhould riſe in his ſleepe, and doe all that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to Baptiſme: Yet it were no ſacrament; becauſe in none of theſe thee there were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie anie humane acte with freedome of will or intention to direct this action, or free mind to worke or not to worke, to Baptize, or not Baptize. So alſo when the nource doth waſh or bath the child, if ſhe ſhould ſay: I bath or waſh thee in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt; no man would be ſo madde, as to thinke ſhe Baptized the child. And why? For no other reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee had no ſuch intention as to Baptize. Wherfore I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, it is neceſſarie to the true effecting of this Sacrament, that the miniſter ought to direct this his exteriour acte to this end and purpoſe, that is to Baptize, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he intend to performe that which Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and commaunded to be done.</p>
               <p>Abſurd then is the opinion of M. Luther and other his followers,<note place="margin">Luth. de cap.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:614:63"/> fainedly. No man can thinke that the Iewes, when they bowed their knees to Chriſt and ſayed: <hi>Aue rex Iudeorum: Haile king of the Iewes,</hi> they intended in deed and veritie to adore him, but rather to ieſt and ſcorne him.

               <p>THat the miniſter of this Sacrament muſt of neceſſitie haue intention, I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the precedent Chapter. The ſchoole-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines diſpute what kind of intention may ſuffice. For there are three kinds of inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Actuall, Habituall, and virtuall. The Habituall all Diuines exclude as not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; for that it may be (ſay they) in a drunken man, a madde man, or in any man that is aſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, for it extendeth not to the acte, but onlie
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:614:63"/> to an inclination or promptitude gotten by the habite.<note place="margin">Arist. Phyſ. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> And therfore the Philoſopher Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſayed, that <hi>Habitus non est actus: The Habite cannot be the acte,</hi> but a promptnes and power to the acte. The Actuall intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is verie good, and to be wished to be in all, who Baptiſe, which is: De facto, and in deed to haue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a mentall intention to execute the acte of Baptiſme, and to doe that the Church doeth, &amp; Chriſt inſtituted. But this is not alwaies of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of the Sacrament; For that men are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſubiect to many diſtractions, and hardly it is in mans power, to be alwayes attentiue vpon thoſe things we haue in hand, although they be holy. Wherfore, if this actuall intention we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re alwayes of neceſſitie, it would often breed much trouble and ſcruple in the mindes of the pious Baptizers, and make vncertaine the acte of Baptiſme. Therfore it is generally holden, that the virtuall intention is ſufficient, that is when one prouideth and intendeth actually to Baptiſe: but yet when he doeth the acte, his mind may be ſo dulled, that he thinke of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or ſo diſtracted, that he haue quite other cogitations. Therfore when we purpoſe to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, it is ſufficient to intend the externall acte of Baptiſme, as inſtituted by Chriſte or vſed by the Church although our mind at the tyme of the acte, may be wandering vpon other things. Neither is it neceſſarie, that we extend our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the effect of Baptiſme, that is that we intend by this actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue grace, to remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te originall ſinne, and to ſanctifie the ſoule. For if this were neceſſarie, we might iuſtly doubt of the Baptiſme of many Heretikes. For the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:614:64"/> and ſome in theſe dayes, denied that Baptiſme did remitte Originall ſinne. Alſo it may be thought, that neither Pagan nor Iew, do thinke of grace or ſanctification of the ſoule when they Baptize. And it is probable, that the Caluiniſts and Puritans of England will not be behind anie of them in this poynt, their dangerous opinion leading them therunto. Wherfore to conclude, it is ſufficient to haue internall intention, to doe in deed and veritie the acte of Baptiſmes, in the maner a foreſaide for ther in is included to doe that which the Church doeth and Chriſt inſtituted. To take away all intention in the Baptizer (as Luther would) were to make a Parrate that can ſpeake, to Baptiſe.</p>

               <p>But for further confutation, I will allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge two or three examples out of Scripture, that to be borne of faith full parents, is not a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t meanes to free them from contracting Originall ſinne, or being contracted, therfore not to haue it imputed.

               <p>Thirdlie the Church hath euer taught, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, and deliuered it as from the Apoſtles to be lawfull, yea neceſſarie to Baptize children and Infants. And no man can denie, but that Baptiſme of children hath bene euer held as an Apoſtolicall tradition. Wherfore although
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:614:70"/> it be not expresſly commaunded in Scripture, yet it is ſufficientlie collected and deducted (as I haue proued) and no way contradicted, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lawfullie to be practiſed. We read in the hiſtorie of the Apoſtles:<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Therfore I abſolutlie anſwere that they can not be ſaued by the parents faith. For (as I haue ſufficientlie proued before) that the ordinarie meanes for the ſaluation of Children, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Originall ſinne is Baptiſme, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not the parents faith. Let this then be a Caueat and warning to all Catholikes and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Chriſtians, to beware of the dangerous doctrine, that many of our Countreymen fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing M. Caluin are not aſhamed publiklie to preach; that <hi>Baptiſme is not neceſſarie to Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Infants; ſo that they be borne of Chriſtian Parents.</hi> As though the Patents faith could make ſafe the child; which is againſt Scripture, Councells, Fathers, and all antiquitie. For that the ordinarie meanes (as I haue ſayed before) for the ſaluation of children is Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>It was decreed by S. Innocencius the firſt Pope of that name, who floriſhed in the tyme of S. Ierome and S. Auguſtine: <hi>That children, althought borne of Christian Parents, ought to be borne againe by Baptiſme, that in them that which they contracted by birth and genration, ſhould be

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no doubt it is a deadlie and mortall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in the Parents, if by their negligence the child die vnder their hands without Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Surely then I may conclude that this doctrine of Caluins, is but a tricke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to make Parents careleſſe of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he may bring their Children to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger of ſaluation, and to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues not free from ſinne. I haue heard of ſome greate perſonages, who for pompe at Chriſtening, and to haue ſome hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſon for Godfather, haue delayed and neglected Baptiſme, and ſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant dying without it, by the Parents pride and negligence haue beene ſent vnto hell. What griefe this ought to be in Parents iudge you, and what ſinne it was in them, I haue cenſured before. Becauſe this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Caluin is too pregnant in our
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:614:74"/> Countrey of England,<note place="margin">Cal. li. <hi>4.</hi> Inst. ca. <hi>16.</hi> Obiect.</note> and ſome of the beſt ſeeme to incline vnto it, I will ſolue all his arguments.</p>
               <p>The firſt obiection is out of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where God made pacte and promiſe to Abraham,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.</note> that he would be a God vnto him; and this promiſe was not onlie made vnto him for his owne perſon, but to his ſeed and poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie after him: but all the Children of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are of the ſeed of Abraham. Therfore they are not ſo properlie iuſtified by the acte of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as by the promiſe God made to the ſeed of Abraham.<note place="margin">Sol. Kelli. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Suruay.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But this argument hath Doctour Kelliſon moſt learnedly anſwered. Firſt although God made this promiſe to Abrahams ſeed, yet after he inſtituted Circumciſion, and threatened all thoſe who had it not, that they ſhould perish; but Circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was a figure of Baptiſme; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although we be partakers of the benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; yet we muſt be Baptized, or els we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish eternallie. Secondlie this promiſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction is to be vnderſtood either carnally or ſpiritually; If carnallie; then it belongeth only to the Iewes, who where of the ſeed and flesh of Abraham, and the carnall children of him; If ſpirituallie, then they onlie are partakers, who,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</note> as S. Paule ſayeth: <hi>Doe imitate the faith &amp; workes of Ahraham.</hi> For ſo are they made the Children of Abraham. But the Children of the faithfull doe no way imitate Abrahams faith or workes, vntill they be Baptized, and receaue the Sacrament of faith, wherby they are in deed: <hi>Verè fideles,</hi> and become trulie faithfull. For as we haue proued before, the Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not haue
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:614:74"/> faith but by Baptiſme. For actuall faith they are not capable of, and habituall faith they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue infuſed in them only by Baptiſme. Therfore that they be the children of Abraham, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie they be Baptized to receaue faith. Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlie this abſurditie would follow, that children ſhould not contract Originall ſinne, which we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to reuiue the Pelagian hereſie. For if children be iuſtified by this that they are of the ſeed of Abraham, yf you vnderſtand it according to the fleſh, there is no doubt, but in the firſt inſtance of their conception, they are of Abrahams ſeed, and ſo conſequentlie iuſtified; Therfore not borne in Originall ſinne. Wherfore we muſt needes conclude, that this place of Scripture no way can proue M. Caluins opinion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond obiection is out of S. Paule,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he ſayeth: <hi>That the vnbeleeuing man is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the faithfull woman; and that the Children of them are cleane and holy.</hi> Therfore the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be borne ſanctified by the Fathers faith. To this I anſwere,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that no man will thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke if a Turke ſhould marrie a Chriſtian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and be content to liue with her, and let her vſe her conſcience, that the Turke therby ſhould be ſanctified and made luſt. Or if a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t marrie with a Catholike woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to liue with her, &amp; let her vſe her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that therfore the Proteſtant becomes a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. But it may verie well be thought, that by the prayer of the wife, by her perſwaſion, by her good example of life, the Turke may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Chriſtian, the Proteſtant a Catholike, but the one muſt be Baptized, and the other reconciled, or els the faith of the woman will
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:614:75"/> not ſuffice. So I ſay the faith of the Parents without the Sacraments of Baptiſme can not cleanſe or waſh the ſoule of the Infant from O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſinne contracted. But this benefit the Child may haue being borne of Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that they will, and are bound to haue care, and ſeeke the onlie remedie for the ſoule of their Children, which is Baptiſme. Therfore Saint Auguſtine ſayeth:<note place="margin">Aug. li. <hi>3.</hi> de a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima. &amp;c. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Si vis eſſe Catholicus, noli dicere, noli docere, noli cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, Infantes &amp;c. If thou wilt be a Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, doe not ſay, doe not teach, doenot beleeue, that Infants dying before the come to Baptiſme, can obtaine indulgence, pardon, or remiſſion of originall ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly I anſwere that the Pelagians vrged this place of Saint Paule againſt Saint Auguſtine, to proue that Children borne of faithfull Parents did not contract Originall ſinne; and ſo conſequentlie were not to be Baptized to take away Originall ſinne. And Caluin vrgeth the ſame place, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring plainly to ſay, that Infants doe not contract from their Parents Originall ſinne, but to proue by their Fathers faith, that they may be ſaued without Baptiſme, becauſe Originall ſinne shall, not be imputed. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame anſwere Saint Auguſtine gaue to the Pelagians I thinke may alſo ſatisfie the Caluiniſts.<note place="margin">Aug. li. <hi>2.</hi> de Pect. meritis ca. <hi>26.</hi> &amp; l. <hi>3.</hi> ca. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> Firſt Saint Auguſtine ſayeth, that the cleanneſſe, ſanctitie, and holines, that the children haue from their parents, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth not meane to be ſanctitie or holines to Iuſtification, ſaluation, or to remiſſion of ſinnes. For then it would follow, that the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:614:75"/> Turke or Infidell should be ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing woman, and that by the verie coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of matrimonie he ſhould become Iuſt and ſaued, which were againſt Scripture and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Haeb.</hi> 11.</note> becauſe it is impoſſible to pleaſe God wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout faith.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is manifeſt by Scripture that Chriſt hath layd an other foundation of Iuſtification &amp; ſaluation then the beleeuing woman for the husband, and the faith of the Parents for the Infant, and that is, to be borne againe by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Holy Ghoſt, and to be incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te to Chriſt by Baptiſme. No doubt but the true ſenſe and meaning of the Apoſtle was, not to ſeperate man and wife, although they were different in Religion; becauſe who knoweth whether one may be an occaſion of the others Conuerſion, ſayeth the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>So alſo the Parent may be a cauſe of the Saluation of the Infant, in ſeekeing to haue the Sacrament dulie miniſtered. And thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth S.

               <p>Yet it is the more generall opinion of the greater part of Diuines that their ſorrow and grief can be but ſmall and litle; becauſe they haue manie cauſes to lenifie and mitigate this their grief and ſorrow. Although they had a knowledge of God, and were not ignorant of ſome kind of beatitude and bleſſednes: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they neuer had any acte or habite to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, wherby they might attaine vnto it but a weake, remote, and farre of diſpoſition onlie, which could effect nothing: therfore their grief ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be great for the loſſe of that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

And becauſe neither of them, children nor fooles, are capable of actuall faith as thoſe at mans eſtate and vnderſtanding, are therfore we Catholikes ſay that: <hi>Aliena fides: The fait of an other,</hi> that is of the Church is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for them. But for thoſe of the elder ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te and of vnderſtanding, we defend that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie they haue actuall faith, or els it will be with them as it was with Iudas, who receaued the Sacrament of the Bodie of our Lord at the hands of Chriſt in his laſt ſupper, but not the effect of the Sacrament, becauſe he receaued vnworthelie to his owne damnation. So alſo he that approcheth to Baptiſme fainedly wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout faith may &amp; doth receaue the Sacrament, and hath the character and ſigne of a Chriſtian, but he ſhall neuer haue the effect and end of the Sacrament, that is grace, Iuſtification, or ſaluation.

               <p>In like manner we read of ſome Sarracens &amp; Turkes, who deſire baptiſme, not with true faith

And in the new law inſtituted by Chriſt are the Sacraments of the Church, the making of the ſigne of Chriſt crucified, the croſſe, the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the knee at the name of Ieſus, praying with our mouth, lifting our eyes and hands towards heauen &amp;c.

               <p>THe ceremonies of Baptiſme are of three ſorts: Some precedent, going before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:614:88"/> Some concurring with Baptiſme; and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſubſequent, and following Baptiſme. Or we may make our diuiſion: ſome before the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized come vnto the fonte: ſome at the fonte and other ſome after he is taken out of the fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. The precedent, or before the Infant come to the fonte, are ſuch as are giuen for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preparing of the Infant to be Baptized, and to take away all obſtacles, lettes and hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that the Sacrament may haue his full ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Alſo to weaken the power of Satan, who would plead poſeſſion by reaſon of ſinne in the ſoule: The other Ceremonies, ſuch as are, when the partie to be Baptized cometh to the fonte, are the naming of the child, the Godfathers and Godmothers, the abrenuntiation of Satan, and all his pompes and pride, the profeſſion of faith, the Baptizing with the water &amp; word ioyntlie, with three merſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The ceremonies ſubſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or after the Baptiſed is taken out of the fonte, are the vſe of holie Chriſme, the annoynting on the crowne of the head, the Godfathers and Godmothers laying their hands on his head, the cloathing with the white garment commonlie called the Chriſome, the giuing him the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or taper light in his hand; all which in this booke and ſequent treatiſe in ſeuerall Chapters I will ſette downe, and ſhew the vſe and reaſon of them. And there is not the leaſt rite or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of this Sacrament of Baptiſme now vſed in the Catholike Church, which either die not deſcend by Tradition from the Apoſtles, or we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not inſtituted by the Holie Church, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ancient Fathers, and practiſed for many ages, vntill of late tyme theſe Nouelants

               <p>I anſwere they are neceſſarie: <hi>Ad bene eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,</hi> but not <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> that is they are no eſſentiall parts of the Sacrament: yet they are to the Decorum and beautie of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For in caſe of neceſſitie there is no doubt (as I haue proued before) but this Sacrament may be miniſtred without theſe Ceremonies, becauſe they are not of the eſſence and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Baptiſme. Yet no man ſhall or can denie; but that they are helpes and comforts to the Baptized, inſtructions, and ſignes to the ſtanders by, and ornaments for the more ſolemne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing of this Sacrament, Which is the gate and firſt entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Chriſtianitie.

First becauſe they are means to ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vp and moue the minds of the beleeuing and faithfull people to greater deuotion and reuerence vnto this Sacrament, for that there is greater miſterie in this Sacrament more then the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall waſhing which is ſhewed by water.

               <p>THe Cuſtome of the Catholike Church is, that the Prieſt come to meete the Child at the Church dore, to ſignifie that the Infant as yet is not of the houſhould of the faithfull and congregation of Chriſt, but ſtandeth at the gate readie to enter into the Church of God. And the firſt action he doth is to ſigne the Baptized with the ſigne of the Croſſe firſt in the forehead ſaying: <hi>Signum Saluatoris &amp;c. The ſigne of our Sauiour our Lord Ieſus Chriſt I place or put in thy Forehead.</hi> And then to the breaſt ſaying and doing the like: <hi>The ſigne of our Sauiour our Lord Ieſus Christ I put vpon thy breast.</hi> This is the practiſe of the Chatholike Church. Concerning this Cheremonie of the Signe of the Croſſe, the Proteſtants Commend highly as a lawfull Ceremonie, and honorable badge, wherby the Infant is dedicated to the ſeruice of Chriſt, who dyed on the Croſſe.<note place="margin">Confer. fol. <hi>72.</hi>
                  </note> Therfore it is Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their Communion-Booke, approued by the ſupreame power the King and Cleargie, and defended againſt the Puritan, and preciſer ſort of Miniſters in their booke of Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;<note place="margin">

Firſt becauſe amongſt the Iewes the Croſſe was ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hatefull, and the Apoſtles were deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for beleeuing in Chriſt, who was Crucified
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:614:90"/> vpon the Croſſe. Notwithſtanding the Apoſtles and Primitiue Chriſtians therby were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, but the rather gloried in the Croſſe of Chriſt, according to that of S. Paule: <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glorie, ſauing in the Croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. tract. in Ioa. <hi>43.</hi>
                  </note> And therfore ſayeth S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine: <hi>The Croſſe is fixed and fastened to the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rehead of the faithfull, that they being Chriſtians may ſay: God forbid that I should glorie, ſauing in the Croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Christ, and not be ashamed of Chriſt crucified.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.</note> Secondly in the Apoſtles tyme the ſigne of the Croſſe was of ſuch honour, dignitie, and eſteeme among Chriſtians, that not onlie the vſed it in all their actions to ſigne themſelues with the ſigne of the Croſſe, but alſo to dicated their children by that ſigne to the ſeruice of Chriſt, when they were to be Baptized; therfore an ancient, honorable and lawfull ceremonie: Thirdlie it began not onlie to be a bage &amp; Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of a Chriſtian, to be diſtinguiſhed from Iewe and Gentill, but alſo a defence and weapon againſt Satan, and the aſſaultes of the diuell. For Satan when he ſawe the ſigne of the Croſſe made, he remembred the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Chriſt had ouer him vpon the Croſſe; and therfore abhorreth and flieth from that ſigne, as a ſigne of his deſtruction and Calamitie: And we read that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Chriſtians, who haue faith in Chriſt crucified, haue bene defended from power of Satan by the ſigne of the Croſſe, but ſuch vertue hath God ſhewed by that ſigne, and daylie doth, that euen

                  </note> And S. Gregorie one of the fower Doctors of the Church, reporteth the hiſtorie of a Iewe, who had no faith nor hope in the Paſſion of Chriſt: yet in trauell being benighted, and ſo forced to lodge in the temple of Apollo, he made the ſigne of the Croſſe vpon him; and as he thus lay ſigned with the Croſſe, a great companie of diuells entred. The maiſter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ſeeing one ly in the temple, ſent ſome of the other diuells to ſee who he was that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:614:91"/> preſumed to take vp his lodging, in the temple of Apollo. They brought word that he was: <hi>Vas vacuum, ſed ſignatum: A voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and emptie veſſell, but ſigned with the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the Croſſe.</hi> At which words the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le companie vaniſhed out of ſight. By which examples and authorities, we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſigne of the Croſſe to be a defence againſt diuells, and a putter to flight of euill ſpirits, as alſo ſpirituall vertue againſt the ſnares and wiles of Satan. Wherefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re worthilie vſed not onlie as a badge of a Chriſtian, but alſo as a protection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ambuſhes and craſtie fetches of the enemie of mankind. And this may be effected either by the apprehenſion of the diuell, for then they flie when they ſee the Croſſe, whereby they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered; or among the Chriſtians by him that maketh the ſigne of the Croſſe with deuotion, for that the Croſſe is a memorie and a certaine inuocation of the merits of Chriſts paſſion; or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Infidells and Pagans, in whom there is no fayth nor beleefe in Chriſt, it doth worke euen by the verie doing and making of the Croſſe, as may appeare in the examples alleadged, where the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie making of the ſigne of the Croſſe made the diuells to flie. Wherfore to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude laudable, ancient, and profitable is the vſe of the ſigne of the Croſſe in Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Although the Proteſtants agree and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:614:92"/> accord with vs to vſe the ſigne of the Croſſe in Baptiſme: yet becauſe they will be Schiſmatikes from the Catholike Church, and from the firſt founders of Chriſtianitie in this land, both a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong the Brittons and Saxons, they differ in three poynts. Firſt, for that they ſigne the child after Baptiſme and not before, as we Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes doe, as though the Croſſe were not a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as well to expell Satan the enemie of man, as to be a badge and Cognizance of Chriſtian profeſſion. Secondlie, they omitte to ſigne the Child in the breaſt, for if it be lawfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to vſe the Croſſe in the forehead, for an outward ſigne of profeſſion of Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vpon the Croſſe, why alſo doe they not vſe it vpon the breaſt, where the harte is, that it may ſignifie that this profeſſion of the Croſſe, proceedeth alſo from the harte and inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Thirdlie, the Proteſtants ſeeme to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate that the Catholikes make the ſigne of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will not ſay there are no Infidells, for that Atheiſme and hereſie (as hath bene ſayed) is a kind of Infidelitie or misbeleefe; but how that countrey ſwarmeth with ſuch kind of people. <hi>Notum est omnibus:</hi> It is knowen to all the world. The ſecond cauſe why this ceremonie is not in vſe in England is, becauſe it was neuer heard of as yet, that euer any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant conuerted to Chriſtianitie anie Iewe, Turke or Pagan, although it be moſt manifeſt,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:614:93"/> they haue had dealing and traffike with all three and haue of late ſought to plant them ſelues in ſome Pagan partes of the world, as Guiana and Virginea: yet did we not heare of anie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion to Chriſtianitie in anie parte or place of the world.

               <p>It was my Chance being in Spaine, to haue ſome Conference with one Muſtafan à Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanian by birth, a Turke by profeſſion, to beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me a Chriſtian. His anſwere was, that in deed the new Chriſtians in England, (for ſoe he tearmed them in reſpect of their new opinions and reuolt from the old) came nearer to his Religion then the old Chriſtians in Spayne did. For that they of England had no Images, nor pictures of Chriſt nor his Saintes. Alſo they of England loued them better then they of Spay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne did; yet ſayed he, if I ſhould turne Chriſtian, I had rather turne to the old of Spayne, then the newe of England, for the elder the nearer to Chriſt, and ſo the more likelier to be true. Thus this Mauritanian Turke could diſtinguiſh &amp; make his choyſe between new and old Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and new and old Chriſtianitie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may conclude that the Proteſtants nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue, nor can haue ordinarilie the vſe of this Ceremonie of the Cathecumines in their Church, nor be Baptizers of Turkes or Pagans, nor Conuerters of Countreyes.</p>

                  </note> where he exhorteth to this Ceremonie, and proueth it by Apoſtolicall authoritie. And in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:614:95"/> the ſixth Chapter of the ſame epiſtle, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the reaſon, why the Romain Catholike Church doth not vſe anie ſolemne Baptization on the Epiphanie day commonlie called the twelth day, although in the opinion of ſome vpon that day Chriſt himſelf was Baptized in Iordan by Iohn Baptiſt.

               <p>The puritan or preciſer ſort of Miniſters, would ſeeme to ayme at this laudable ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and cuſtome of the Catholike Church; for willinglie they would, if anie Child be borne in the weeke day, differre and put of his Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation vntill the Sunday. Which if they doe, becauſe euerie ſunday is and ſo we account it as the Octaue day of Paſcha or Pentecoſte; then I thinke, if the Child be ſtrong and no way in danger of death, this ceremonie of differing Baptiſme vntill the ſunday, may be approuable. But if they doe differre Baptization for an other end and purpoſe, which rather is to be feared, and that is to broach, approue and allow the opinion of M. Caluin, that Children may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without this Sacrament, and ſoe to induce &amp; breed in the mind of the Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts a careleſſnes, and negligence to ſee this Sacrament duelie performed; and ſo conſequentlie to endanger the ſaluation of the child, then this Ceremonie is not to be ſufferred, but dangerous and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:614:95"/> For in doubtfull and dangerous caſes, the ſecurer &amp; ſafer way is euer to be followed. And for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of this I will recite the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of Samuel Hubert the miniſter,<note place="margin">Reſcius in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſm.</note> who ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized a chyld on the weake daye, beinge called vp at middinght by the Parents, and vrged ther vnto, in reſpect the Infant was in danger of death. Muſculus the ſuperintendent hearinge of it, complayned to the counſell of the citie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did baptiſe before the ſoundaye. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert beinge cited to appeare was accuſed for this fact of hereſie and rebellion: but he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge for himſelfe, ſayed, that he did baptiſe before the ſoundaye in caſe of neceſſitie, which he thought lawfull in reſpect of the danger of the chyld, who dyinge without baptiſme myght be in danger not only of death of bodie, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of ſoule. But Muſculus with other miniſters replied, yet the wante of baptiſme did not hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Infant from the ſight of God and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But Hubert conſtantly auerred befor the counſel and ſenat that this propoſition was he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall, becauſe it mayintaned yet children could be ſaued without baptiſme. Vppon this contention Beza in his oldage, (for this was in the yeare of our lord 1595.) was called and conſulted with all, alſo other miniſters of baſill and Zurike were preſent, the matter being debated among them, Hubert was by them for this fact condemned, and depriued of his miniſterie: ſo that we may conclud, that this delayinge of baptiſme vntill ſoundaye, is but to pach vp this hereſie, and make parents careleſſe of Chriſtianitie in their poſteritie.</p>

We knowe Chriſt could haue healed the dume man and blind borne without touchinge, ſpeach, ſpittle, claye, waſhinge or any other ceremonie, &amp; we affirme that baptiſme maye haue his effecte without theſe ceremonies: but dare any man ſaye, that in Chriſt the vſe of ſpittle was ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

               <p>NOw being come to our thyrd diuiſion of ceremonies which are to be done and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted after baptiſme, you ſhall vnderſtand that they are three in number, which the Catholick church doth ſpecially practiſe; The fyrſt is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with holy chriſme vppon the topp or crowne of the head. The ſecond is the chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me or white garment which is put vppon the baptiſed. The third is the taper or waxe candle light and burning beinge geuen and putt in the right hand of the baptized. All which three the Proteſtants neglect or contemne as vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not honorable nor ſignificant, and haue quiet blotted them out of theire bookes. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerninge the fyrſt. Soe ſoone as the child is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the font, the prieſt doth annoynt him not with holy oyle as before on the breaſt and ſhoulders: but with holy Chriſme and that on the crowne of the head; to ſignifie that now he is become a Chriſtea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſo called of Chriſt,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:614:109"/> which is as much as vnctus, annoynted; and therfor an annoynted Chriſtean, and then he vſeth this oriſon or prayer. <hi>God omnipotent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hath regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee of water and the holy ghost, and alſo who hath geuen thee remiſſion of all thy ſynnes, he doth annoynt the With the criſme of oyle of health into life everlaſtinge.</hi>

And Rabanus wryteth to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, after ſayeth he, the child is taken out of the font preſently he is ſigned <hi>in cerebro,</hi> in the crowne of the head with ſacred Chriſme to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the prayer of the prieſt, that he may be made partaker of the kingdome of Chriſt, and of Chriſt be called a Chriſtean. S. Ambroſe goeth farther and asketh the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. <hi>Quare Caput?</hi>

Now for the antiquitie therof that it was vſed in the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue church, we haue amonge the decrees and rites of the church which were published and inſtituted by S. Sylueſter the fyrſt pope of that name who baptiſed Conſtantine the great and fyrſt chriſtean Emperor; <hi>vt praesbiter baptizati Chriſmate ſummum liniret verticem.</hi> That the prieſt should annoynt the crowne of the head of the baptized, with chriſme.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:614:110"/> Alſo S. Hierome reporteth that in his tyme,<note place="margin">in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logo contra lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranos.</note> it waz not lawfull for the prieſts to baptiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out chriſme. What reaſon then haue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of this age not to allowe, but to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect and contemne ſo ſignificant a ceremonie I knowe no reaſon but one becauſe they are not <hi>vncti domini,</hi> the annoynted of our lord. And as the Spayniards commonly ſaye <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steanos may no veros Chriſteanos.</hi> Chriſteans by name, but not trwe Chriſteans in dead, but misbeleeuers of Chriſtian miſteries, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the rites and ceremonies of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtean Catholick church.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. XXI.</hi> Whether the vſe of puttinge vppon the baptiſed the white garment be not ſignificant.</head>
               <p>THe vſe of this ceremonie of clothinge the baptiſed with a white veſture or garment or with a linnen cloth commonly called the chriſome, as the manner and cuſtome of our countrie of England hath bine, is on this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. The prieſt after he hath annoynted the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſed vppon the head, taketh the chriſome or white garment and ſayeth, <hi>Accipe vestem candidam &amp;c. Receaue and take the bright, white holly and immaculate veſture, which thou mayeſt carrie befor the tribunal of our lord Ieſus Christ and that thou mayest haue life eternall and liue for euer,</hi> this is the ceremonie with the prayer. The ſacred ſcripture doth often allude to this
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:614:110"/> ceremonie of white veſtments and clothinge. And fyrſt in Chriſts transfiguration did not his garments turne and become white as ſnowe?<note place="margin">Matth. <hi>17.</hi> Luc. <hi>9.</hi> Mar. vlto. Act. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> And the Angelicall veſture was it not white when they appeared to the holly women the three Maries at the ſepulcher of our lord the daye of his reſurrection? alſo when they ſpake to the Apoſtles after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt they were all in white. And how often doth S. Iohn in the Apocalips diſcribe the ſayntes to be clothed in white garmentes, white ſtolles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.</note> white robes. In the thyrd chapter it is ſayed, that there were ſome in the church of Sardis, who had not after baptiſme defiled their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes with deadly ſynne, and thoſe are they who shall walke with god in whites, <hi>ambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt mecum in albis,</hi> becauſe they are worthie. he that shall ouercome, shall thus be veſted in white garments, and I will not putt his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me out of the book of lyfe. Alſo deſcribeth how he ſawe the foure and twenty ſeniors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the throne clothed in white garments alſo he declareth that the ſoules who were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the alter had white ſtolles geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one had on.<note place="margin">

The white veſture which is geuen immediatly after baptiſme to the baptiſed hath three or foure ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s deduced out of Scriptur. Fyrſt it is geuen in the memorie and ſigne of the glorious reſurrection, for all thoſe who are regenerated and borne agayne by baptiſme, are capable and may be made partakers of Chriſts glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and ſo to walk with god in whits.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:614:111"/> Secondly to ſignifie what we haue gotten and obtayned by baptiſme, that is innocencie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>white ſoule, cleane washed from all ſpottes and ſtaynes of ſynne. Thyrdly to ſignifie and putt vs in mynd, of that puritie of lyfe which euerie one ought to obſerue and keepe after baptiſme,<note place="margin">

Paule, that we maye walke in newnes of lyfe; Forthly and laſt of all, to putt vs in mynde of the glorie of the next life, for there we muſt be ſtandinge in the ſight of the lambe clothed in white robes, For <hi>nullum coinquinatum</hi> nothinge defiled shall enter into heauen, and thus much for the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification. Wherfor I doubt not but that I maye conclud this ceremonie to be ſignificant to haue his inſtruction and ſignification. Now for the antiquitie we haue the teſtimonie of S. Dioniſius in his eccleſiaſticall Hierarchie. and the ſame confirmeth S. Ambroſe lib. <hi>de ijs qui initian: miſte c.</hi> 7. Alſo of auncient tyme the octaue daye of paſcha or Eaſter, is and was called <hi>dominica in albis, the ſounday in whites,</hi> becauſe after that daye the Neophits, that is to ſaye thoſe who were newly baptiſed, ether vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Eaſter euen or vppon the daye, beinge clothed at their baptiſme in whits, did vſually on the ſoundaye after put of thoſe white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Ita tamen,</hi> ſayeth S.

            <p>IN this treatiſe gentle reader, hath binne briefly shewed and by queſtions declared vnto thee, what baptiſme is, the effects therof, the matter, the forme, the miniſter, the partie baptized, and finally the reaſons of the rites and ceremonies, and with all howe honorable, ſignificant, profitable, and comfortable they are to chriſtian people. The lyk may be declared of the other ſyxe ſacraments, but not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected at my hands. For I will promiſe no more then I meane to performe. The catholik church hath euer mayntayned ſeauen ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which chriſt himſelfe and no other could inſtitute. And this was the bountie and goodnes of our ſauiour chriſt, therby to aſſiſt and comfort man to make this his paſſage in this vale of miſerie. So that chriſt would not leaue vs without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie all the tyme of our life, euen from the houre of our birth vnto the daye of our death, baptiſme at our birth, Confeſſion, the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſte with the other ſacraments all the middle of our life, and extreame vnction at our death. It is wonderfull to conſider, what eaſie way the proteſtans haue found out, they haue cutt of fiue of theſe ſeaven ſacraments, and would ſeeme to retayne only two. But in verie deed they haue but bare one, And that is baptiſme, which is allowed to be miniſtred by them and of them in caſe only of neceſſetie. And this one which they retayne, god knoweth they haue pilled and pouled, and the puritans iſſuinge from them haue endouered to roote it quit vp,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:614:113"/> as may appeare by this precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t treatiſe. As for the lords ſupper as they call, it it is with them no Sacrament for they haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration, no change of bread into the bodie of Chriſt, bread befor and bread after, you maye make as good a Communion ar home in takinge bread at break faſt, in memorie that chriſt dyed for you.
